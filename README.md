#Wyoming Critical and Strategic Minerals 

This repository is home to the data processing scripts for processing NURE and WSGS geochemical datasets. 
All scripts were written in Jupyter notebooks, and most imports are stated at the top of each notebook.

##Notebooks are as follows
Critical minerals - initial EDA and imputation models
Imputed Critical mineral EDA - reads in the imputated datasets and creates training/test datasets for validation
NURE date samples - reads in the nure data and visualizes the temporal collection of the dataset
